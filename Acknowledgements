The authors would like to thank Paul Brodersen for his detailed NetworkX implementation of multi-layer graphs, onto which the 3D view function of this package is based on.
We also want to mention Petter Holme and Jari Saramäki's book "Temporal Network Theory", whose chapters on temporal graph layouts and analysis helped shape this project.
