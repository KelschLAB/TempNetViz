To start the GUI, simply run python tempgraphviz.main_gui If you do not have Python installed, or are not familiar with it, you can download tempgraphviz as an excucutable file here . Quickstart Your data should be stored in a single folder, as .csv files . Each .csv file representing a graph at a given time point of the analysis. Run python tempgraphviz.main_gui or open the excutable. Then: Click Open to select the folder containing your .csv graph files. Use the Sub-graph selector to choose one or multiple graph layers to visualize/analyse. Adjust the layout and metrics to explore structural properties. Optionally apply a graph cut for better readability on large graphs. Switch between Graph , Histogram , and Animation views for different insights. Main Functionalities Structure visualization Once you have selected the input files to be visualized, the default view will be a 3D stack that lets you see how connections evolve as a function of time. You can also compute various metrics that quantify the importance of the nodes in the graph. More important nodes will be displayed larger as others.

In such cases, graph pruning can help improve visibility while preserving the essential features in the data. TempGraphViz offers several ways to do this, available with the graph cut button. Graph cuts are used to simplify the network by removing weak or irrelevant edges , making patterns easier to analyze and visualize. Below is a list of the available cut or pruning methods available. Threshold Cut Removes the weakest connections in the graph. You choose a percentage (relative to the strongest connection), and all edges below this level are hidden. Example: If the strongest connection has weight 100, and you set the threshold to 10%, then all edges weaker than 10 are removed. Best for: filtering out background noise while keeping dominant patterns visible. Nearest Neighbors Cut (NN Cut) For each node, only its top k strongest connections are kept. You decide how many neighbors should remain connected (e.g., k = 2 or 3...). Each node stays connected to a limited number of its closest partners. Best for: focusing on local structures around each node and avoiding clutter from weak links. Mutual Nearest Neighbors Cut (MNN Cut) A stricter version of NN Cut. Here, a connection between two nodes is kept only if both nodes rank each other among their top neighbors . Creates a much sparser graph, highlighting only the most reciprocal and reliable relationships . Best for: revealing core structures and strongly linked communities. Quick Guide: Which Cut to Choose? Method What it shows best Use it when\u2026 Threshold Cut Strong connections vs. weak noise You want to filter out background clutter NN Cut Local neighborhoods You want each node to show its closest relationships MNN Cut Reciprocal strong links You want to see the most reliable and symmetric structures","title":"Graph cut"},{"location":"graph_cut/#graph-cut","text":"When working with large graphs, a direct representation of every single link can quickly become overcrowded.

These metrics determine how nodes are sized , colored , and how statistics are displayed. Available Metrics Metric Description None No node-specific metric is applied. The graph displays raw edge weights only. Strength The sum of edge weights connected to a node. A higher strength means the node has stronger or more numerous connections. Betweenness Measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act as important bridges in the network. Closeness Reflects how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. Nodes with high closeness can reach others quickly (shorter average path length). Eigenvector Centrality Measures a node\u2019s influence based on the idea that connections to important nodes contribute more than connections to less important ones. PageRank A variant of eigenvector centrality. It gives higher scores to nodes connected to other highly connected nodes. Originally developed for ranking webpages. Hub Score In the HITS algorithm , hubs are nodes that point to many authoritative nodes. A high hub score means the node is a good \u201cinformation provider.\u201d Authority Score The complement of the hub score in the HITS algorithm . A node has a high authority score if many hubs point to it, making it an important \u201cinformation source.\u201d Rich-Club Identifies a subset of nodes (the \u201crich club\u201d) that are highly connected among themselves . The parameter k controls the minimum degree for inclusion. Nodes outside the club are down-weighted. K-Core Identifies the largest subgraph where every node has at least k connections within the group. Useful for finding tightly knit groups . Notes For Rich-Club and K-Core , you must specify a degree parameter k . Metrics affect how nodes are displayed: Size \u2192 proportional to the metric value. Color \u2192 mapped via the selected colormap. In histogram mode, metrics determine the values plotted.
