# Summary

Temporal graph analysis is a growing area of research focused on understanding how networks evolve over time. As an inherently multidisciplinary field, it draws on diverse methodologies, which can make initial exploration and comparison difficult due to the absence of standardized conventions.
In this context, effective visualization plays a crucial role by providing an accessible and intuitive entry point into the data. It supports early-stage exploration, highlights structural and temporal patterns, and helps guide subsequent analytical decisions.

# Statement of need
Currently, there are no (**DOUBLE CHECK**) widely available graphical user interfaces (GUIs) designed specifically for the interactive exploration and analysis of temporal graphs. This presents a significant barrier, particularly in fields such as biology and the social sciences, where temporal networks are commonly encountered. 
Researchers in these domains often lack extensive programming experience, making it difficult for them to use existing tools, which are typically code-based and require specialized technical knowledge. As a result, valuable insights can remain inaccessible without more user-friendly, visual approaches to temporal graph analysis.

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
